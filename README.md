# Semester-Project-1_Elise-Marie-Hogsnes

This is the HTML & CSS course assignment by Elise Marie Hogsnes, from the August 2022 frontend development class, Noroff. This project shows my version of the rainyDay task.

## Description

This project is the web version based on the semester project and the design created from that.
This website will display a museum page aimed at children and teenagers (ages 7-15) and families with younger children. This website shows what the museum has to offer in terms of activities, exhibitions and other relevant information such as location, contact information and more general information about the museum and their cause.

The reasons for this are further discussed in a separate report on the project.
