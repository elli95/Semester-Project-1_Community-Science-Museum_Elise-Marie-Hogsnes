              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet
              a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

              For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding
              of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the
              discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.

            <h3>
              Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow
              creatures have beat us to it.

              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to

              In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and
